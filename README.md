This repository revives an old 1.1.x version of Hibernate Spatial.

Last known version for Hibernate Spatial was 1.1.3.1, but no doc or repo were found for it.
Sources for 1.1.3.1 have been recovered from sources jar, but test are missing at the moment.

Main changes from 1.1.1 to 1.1.3.1 seems to be:
- updates of groupId for jts
- improvements in GeoDB spatial functions.

Main driver for this recovering is making this old version of hibernate spatial to be compatible with recent API changes in JTS.
